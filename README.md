## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a **College-based Thesis** developed by **Group 6**. We aim to solve the complex challenge of academic room allocation by applying **Quantum-Inspired Annealing (QIA)**. The system efficiently assigns classrooms based on schedules, student capacity, and specific equipment needs, ensuring minimal conflicts and maximum resource utility.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows a modern decoupled architecture:
1.  **Frontend (Next.js):** Provides a sleek, responsive interface for admins and students.
2.  **Backend (Python/FastAPI or Flask):** Houses the QIA algorithm, handling heavy computational tasks and optimization logic.
3.  **Database (Supabase):** Stores room data, user roles, and the final optimized schedules.

## ✨ Key Features

- **QIA Optimization:** Uses simulated quantum effects (like tunneling) to find optimal room assignments faster than traditional brute-force methods.
- **Automated Scheduling:** Reduces manual workload for school registrars and department heads.
- **Conflict Detection:** Real-time validation to ensure no two classes are assigned to the same room at the same time.
- **User Management:** Secure login and role-based access via Supabase Auth.
